My first repository in github.

Once upon a time, a young gamer loved WoW so much that she created a website for her beloved guild, Nebilim's Catalyst. She felt that the name was too long for a website, so she shortened the name to Nebilist and bought the domain.

The day came that she decided that it was too expensive and time consuming to play WoW, so she cancelled her subscription and the website chatroom project was abandoned. But somehow, the name nebilist stuck to her, so she brought up the domain and created a website portfolio. Eventually, it became her username in several places.

Her old projects were old, and she could no longer test any apps she began for WoW, so the only thing she had to show for her coding skills was the website itself, and she has no plans to go into website programming. A fresh start was desired for coding, so this github account was born!

The end! Well, the beginning seems more fitting for this...
